# dotFiles

This is just something that helps me keep track of my different settings and configurations across multiple machines. This is really just for my own benefit, so that reinstalling an OS, or getting a new computer, or working on different computers is less of a pain. However, feel free to look through the files for inspiration on your own settings, or even clone it to take all of the settings. Feel free to do whatever you want with them! Everything is under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/), so if you want to pretend you came up with them on your own, I really wouldn't mind.
